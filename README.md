# Unraveling the Balance: Depth vs. Width in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This tutorial explores the critical impact of **depth** (number of layers) and **width** (number of filters per layer) on the performance, efficiency, and generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It provides a step-by-step analysis through systematic experiments, visualizations, and practical insights.

## **Key Highlights**
1. **Depth Experiment**:
   - Investigates how varying the number of layers affects hierarchical feature extraction and overall performance.
   - Demonstrates the trade-offs between increasing depth, accuracy improvements, and computational efficiency.

2. **Width Experiment**:
   - Explores how varying the number of filters per layer impacts feature diversity and model size.
   - Highlights the balance between wider architectures and computational/memory overhead.

3. **Results**:
   - Identifies the optimal configuration for the given dataset as:
     - **Depth**: 3 layers
     - **Width**: 50 filters per layer
   - Visualizes training and validation loss/accuracy for the optimal configuration.

4. **Techniques Covered**:
   - Experimentation with depth and width.
   - Training and evaluating CNN models using Python and Keras.
   - Plotting and interpreting metrics such as loss, accuracy, training time, and model size.

## **What You'll Learn**
- How depth and width influence CNN performance.
- Practical insights into optimizing CNN architectures for different tasks.
- How to monitor and mitigate issues like overfitting using visualizations.

## **Future Scope**
- Implement regularization techniques like Dropout and early stopping.
- Using the data augmentation techniques.
- Scale depth, width, and input size together for optimal performance.
